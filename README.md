Connected Mobility Assignment 3

Report
======================

The Assignment3.ipnyb Jupyter Notebook contains the code as well as the report, which primarily includes the analysis of generated plots.

Files to generate plots
---------------------

We use Git LFS to store the captured files. To re-generate the plots after cloning the repository use:

```
git lfs pull
```
