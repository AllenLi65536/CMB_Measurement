# CMB_Measurement
Connected Mobility Assignment 3

Report
======================

The Assignment3.ipnyb Jupyter Notebook contains the code as well as the report, which primarily includes the analysis of generated plots.


Files to generate plots (Not necessary needed)
---------------------

We use Git LFS to store the large captured files. To re-generate the plots after cloning the repository use:

```
git lfs pull
```

But it is highly possible that the GitHub LFS bandwidth quota is already used up. So it is better to download the files from following links:

Just uncompress it into the folder CMB_Measurement.
